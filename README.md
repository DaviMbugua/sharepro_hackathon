Problem Statement
In the manufacturing industry, factories often use most of their equipment resources only part of the time, 
even though they have initially invested substantial amounts of money in them. When unused, investments made in production equipment, 
and transport vehicles (vans, trucks) serve no purpose and therefore provide no value to their owners. Furthermore, in the local market, 
it is not easy for small and medium companies to own all the equipment they need for the production and transport of their products hence the need 
for companies that have underused equipment to find each other. 

Solution
Sharepro is a website intended to link the small and medium manufacturing entities with each other so as to rent equipment, 
trucks, or storage facilities e.g freezers from same business category when not in use
